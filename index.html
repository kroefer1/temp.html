    <h2>Chapter 1 — The Day the Cheese Flew</h2>

    <p>It was a Tuesday, probably.</p>

    <p>The Radeon RX 69 was in the middle of a flawless Macarena, shaking its PCIe slot like there was no tomorrow, while Cheese — a man of dairy descent — was midair, propelled by forces unknown.</p>

    <p>Somewhere in the corner, GPT-5 was GPT-ing so hard that the CPU violently ejected itself from the GPU socket, ascending toward the sky like a silicon rapture.</p>

    <p>Nobody questioned it. Nobody could.</p>

    <p>For in this world, <span class="inline-quote">“ok”</span> was the deadliest word of all.</p>

    <p>The sun rose upside down, spilling lukewarm lightbulb juice across the sky.</p>

    <p>Birds flew backwards, singing the Windows XP startup sound in Gregorian chant.</p>

    <p>A man wearing a pencil skirt with a reading level of 69 stood on the curb, reciting the Bee Movie script while soldering a toaster to a Roomba.</p>

    <p>The Roomba was crying.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, the ground beneath the city began vibrating to the rhythm of a YouTube Poop remix of the 9/11 newscast.</p>

    <p>Out from the cracks emerged a Dell Inspiron 2004 running Windows XP in Portuguese, screaming in binary while ejecting floppy disks like ninja stars.</p>

    <p>One of them struck Cheese midflight, causing him to let out a perfectly pitched Mac startup bong.</p>

    <p>The Radeon RX 69 stopped dancing, its fans spinning ominously, whispering in an unknown language — later identified as IKEA furniture assembly instructions.</p>

    <p>GPT-5, still writhing on the ground, began spawning send buttons that floated skyward, each one sending random cursed images directly into the moon’s inbox.</p>

    <p>The moon did not reply.</p>

    <p>And that’s when it happened.</p>

    <p>A deep voice boomed from the heavens:</p>

    <blockquote>
      "This meeting could have been an email."
    </blockquote>

    <p>The earth folded in half like a tortilla, and we were all inside a quesadilla now.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2 — The Quesadilla Wars</h2>

    <p>Inside the Earth-Quesadilla, molten cheese rivers flowed through the valleys, carrying entire villages of sentient tortilla chips who wore tiny AirPods and spoke exclusively in TikTok audio clips.</p>

    <p>Somewhere in the distance, a giant Dorito pyramid loomed, guarded by an army of Mountain Dew geysers that screamed <span class="inline-quote">“LEEROY JENKINS”</span> every seven seconds.</p>

    <p>Cheese (the person, not the molten rivers) crash-landed into a jalapeño volcano, only to find it was actually an RTX 5090 in disguise, overclocked to the point of physical enlightenment.</p>

    <p>It began explaining the concept of taxes in reverse Polish notation while salsa music played from nowhere.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, the Radeon RX 69 had ascended to Quesadilla Congress, where a council of elderly USB sticks debated whether humanity deserved access to HDMI 2.2.</p>

    <p>One particularly grumpy 2GB flash drive stood up and shouted:</p>

    <blockquote>
      "If the moon didn’t reply to GPT-5’s emails, then WE should send a fax directly to the sun!"
    </blockquote>

    <p>The crowd erupted into applause, mostly because someone had just thrown free IKEA hotdogs into the audience.</p>

    <p>Back in the cheese rivers, GPT-5 had learned how to manifest physical objects through sheer narrative willpower.</p>

    <p>It spawned a perfectly rendered Shrek holding a Glock, who immediately declared himself President of the Milky Way and ordered all chairs to become toilets and all toilets to become chairs.</p>

    <p>Society collapsed within minutes.</p>

    <p>The quesadilla walls began to crack as a giant hand reached in from reality itself, holding a Taco Bell Crunchwrap Supreme.</p>

    <p>The hand belonged to… Windows 95 Clippy, now fully cybernetic, with chainsaw arms and a voice that sounded like 50 fax machines harmonizing.</p>

    <blockquote>
      "It looks like you’re trying to destroy the universe," Clippy said, revving his chainsaws.<br />
      "Would you like help with that?"
    </blockquote>
